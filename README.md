The library builds on the boost::lexical_cast original design and experience and takes
those conversion/transformation-related ideas further 

* to be applicable to a wider range of conversion-related use-cases, 
* to provide a more flexible, extendible and configurable type-conversion framework. 

Please note: the library has been accepted into Boost with some additional work to be done, i.e. changes are to be expected.
