The library builds on the boost::lexical_cast original design and experience and takes
those conversion/transformation-related ideas further 

* to be applicable to a wider range of conversion-related use-cases, 
* to provide a more flexible, extendible and configurable type-conversion framework. 

Please note: the library is not part of the Boost library collection even though here and in the accompanying documentation it is referred to as Boost.Convert and the relevant code is under the boost directory. It is done so in preparation for potential submission of the library to Boost.

Documentation is available [here](http://yet-another-user.github.io/boost.convert).
