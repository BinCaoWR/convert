boost.xtra
==========

Boost.Convert builds on the boost::lexical_cast experience and then takes those
conversion-related ideas further to provide more flexible and extendible conversion
framework, richer conversion-related configurability to better suit today's applications
and programming needs. The /Boost.Convert/ framework is split in to two components

* the /Boost.Convert/ API facade to provide simple, minimal and uniform interface and
* the library of purpose-built pluggable converters to provide type conversions depending
on the need.
