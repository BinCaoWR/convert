[section Converters]

`boost::convert()` plays its role by providing a uniform interface and ensuring consistent behavior. However, it is the respective plugged-in converter which does the hard work of turning custom-types into strings and strings into custom-types, etc., i.e. the actual conversion\/transformation. 

For a converter to be plugged in to the ['Boost.Convert] framework it needs to be a ['callable] with the following signature:

 template<typename TypeOut, typename TypeIn>
 bool operator()(TypeIn const& value_in, TypeOut& result_out) const;

if that is a general-purpose converter capable of handling many types (like string-to-type and type-to-string conversions). Alternatively, a purpose-built custom converter might only care to provide 

 bool operator()(TypeIn const& value_in, TypeOut& result_out) const;

if its sole purpose is to handle one particular conversion\/transformation of ['TypeIn] to ['TypeOut]. For example, a converter from the operating-system-specific MBCS string format to the UCS-2 or UCS-4 (depending on `wchar_t` size) does not seem like such an unreasonable idea:

 bool operator()(std::string const& value_in, std::wstring& result_out) const;

Alternatively again, an ad-hoc in-place ['callable] might be provided as a converter. For example, 

 int v = boost::convert<int>(str, boost::bind(assign<int>, _2, boost::bind(boost::lexical_cast<int, std::string>, _1))).value_or(-1);

or an old-fashioned function:

 extern bool my_converter(std::string const&, int&);

 int v = boost::convert<int>(str, my_converter).value_or(-1);

With regard to converters the ['Boost.Convert] framework has been designed with the following requirements in mind:

* converters do not rely on and are not aware of the ['Boost.Convert] framework;
* converters are not concerned with the task of creating a temporary storage for the conversion result; that storage is provided by the framework.
