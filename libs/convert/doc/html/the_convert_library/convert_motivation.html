<p>
      My project used textual configuration files extensively and was processing
      and preparing considerable amounts of data in XML for interprocess communications
      (tasks fairly common these days). Consequently, I had a need for a library
      that would provide a uniform and extendible interface to convert various data
      between their 'native' (internal to an application) binary representations
      and external (predominantly textual, string-based) representations.
    </p>
<p>
      The <span class="emphasis"><em>boost::lexical_cast</em></span> library (with its orthogonal design
      and extendible deployment) looked very promising and was by far the preferred
      candidate compared to others (such as C functions, the <span class="emphasis"><em>std::stringstream</em></span>
      API, etc., see <a href="http://www.gotw.ca/publications/mill19.htm" target="_top">The
      String Formatters of Manor Farm by H. Sutter</a> for the discussion of
      alternatives).
    </p>
<p>
      Unfortunately, many user types/classes did not meet <span class="emphasis"><em>lexical_cast</em></span>
      requirements (namely, DefaultConstructibility); the <span class="emphasis"><em>lexical_cast</em></span>
      behavior of throwing an exception for a conversion failure was not the desired
      behavior and was difficult to work with; additional conversion formatting and
      locale support were needed, etc.
    </p>
<p>
      After discussions with Kevlin Henney (the original <span class="emphasis"><em>lexical_cast</em></span>
      author) and in the Boost Developers forum it was collectively decided that
      the requested extensions were not compatible with the idea of what <span class="emphasis"><em>lexical_cast</em></span>
      embodied and, therefore, a new component with richer interface was needed.
      That decision resulted in the development and the subsequent submission of
      the <span class="emphasis"><em>Boost.Convert</em></span> library described in this document.
